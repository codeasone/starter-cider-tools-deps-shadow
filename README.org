#+TITLE: starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow

*DISCLAIMER:* I'm new to =shadow-cljs= and according to its maintainer this approach
entails running the backend within the =shadow-cljs= server, which is funky!

-

This repo is intended to be a demo-rig and point of reference (early May 2021) for
getting a reasonable full-stack =shadow-cljs= plus =tools.deps= development workflow
under =cider=, given the present limitations of =sesman=.

My work project contains a large number of =clj=, =cljc=, and =cljs= sources, uses
=tools.deps= for dependency management, and /was/ using =figwheel-main= for
live-coding the front-end. Performance and stability of the live re-loading
has become an issue, so the team recently tried =shadow-cljs=.

I had issues arriving at a satisfactory workflow within Emacs, mostly due to some
stupid assumptions on my part.

The following issue reports suggest other people are confused too:

- https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2946
- https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2447

Having spent the last few years working mostly with =figwheel-main= and the
=clojure-cli= build tool, it took a few hours of failed attempts before landing on a
=shadow-cljs= workflow with =cider= that felt satisfactory.

* Preliminaries

If you want to jump into evaluating the workflow using the sample code provided, then
execute =yarn install= after cloning:

Then visit =server.clj= in Emacs and jack-in with =M-x cider-jack-in-clj&cljs=

*NB:* you may need to accept the folder local variables defined in =.dir-locals.el=
as safe

* Take-aways

Use =shadow-cljs= as your =cider= build tool and /not/ =clojure-cli= (even though you're
using =tools.deps= for dependency mgmt)

Consider using the following =.dir-locals.el= to avoid the constant interactive
prompts:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
((nil
  . ((cider-preferred-build-tool . shadow-cljs)
     (cider-default-cljs-repl . shadow)
     (cider-shadow-default-options . "app")
     (cider-offer-to-open-cljs-app-in-browser . nil))))
#+END_SRC

Define the following - or similar - in your =shadow-cljs.edn=:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:deps {:aliases [:dev:frontend:backend]}}
#+END_SRC

So all the dependencies required to start your backend /and/ frontend builds are
available to the REPLs =cider= will be firing up.

Under the =shadow-cljs= build tool, the =clj= REPL will start in the =shadow.user=
namespace (I'm not sure of the background and reasons for this).

So, add a =shadow/user.clj= somewhere on your classpath with the code you typically use
to bring up your backend, for instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns shadow.user
  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
            [starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow.server :as server]))

(def site (handler/site server/app))

(defonce ^:dynamic server nil)

(defn stop
  []
  (when server
    (.stop server)))

(defn start
  [& [port]]
  (stop)
  (alter-var-root
   #'server
   (constantly
    (jetty/run-jetty #'site
                     {:port (Long. (or port 5000))
                      :join? false}))))
#+END_SRC

Don't run =shadow-cljs watch app= in a separate terminal. Instead, jack-in with =M-x
cider-jack-in-clj&cljs= as you've probably always done with =figwheel-main= and
=clojure-cli= before.

You'll see something like the following in the =clj= REPL output:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE clojure

and a "piggy-backed" =cljs= REPL will spring into life with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE clojure

Finally, =start= you backend (serving the HTML which includes the =main.js= from =shadow-cljs= in my contrived example)

#+END_EXAMPLE

Life is good!🍹

We have sibling =clj= and =cljs= REPLs linked to our project.

* What didn't work (and cost me a few hours)

Based on my experience to date working with =cider= and =tool.deps= plus =figwheel=:

** Running =M-x cider-jack-in-clj&cljs= and hoping it would just DWIM

I (mistakenly) chose =clojure-cli= for =cider-preferred-build-tool= when prompted
because I wanted to ensure I could bring up the backend. I assumed I could piggyback
in a =shadow-cljs= REPL, and that it would just DWIM.

Don't do this.

When prompted for the =cljs= repl type, I selected =shadow= and the =:app= build,
after which the following appeared:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. Unhandled clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo
   shadow-cljs has not been started yet!  In embedded mode you need to call
   (shadow.cljs.devtools.server/start!) to start it.  If you have a shadow-cljs
   server or watch running then you are not connected to that process.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Judging by the accompanying stack trace it's not starting the =nrepl= server. Why
wouldn't it do that by default?

Keep in mind at this point I've not run any =shadow-cljs= process in a terminal,
because I just expect =cider= to DWIM on jack-in, given my =shadow-cljs.edn= config
being as it is.

Picking up on =shadow-cljs has not been started yet!= I try running =shadow-cljs
watch app= in a separate terminal (which worked fine):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
➜  starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow git:(master) ✗ shadow-cljs watch app
shadow-cljs - config: /home/mark/Code/Personal/starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow/shadow-cljs.edn

shadow-cljs - watching build :app
[:app] Configuring build.
[:app] Compiling ...
[:app] Build completed. (138 files, 2 compiled, 0 warnings, 3.33s)
#+END_SRC

Great!

...and tried jacking in again

Next =M-x cider-jack-in-clj&cljs=: same error

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
shadow-cljs has not been started yet!  In embedded mode you need to call
(shadow.cljs.devtools.server/start!) to start it.  If you have a shadow-cljs
server or watch running then you are not connected to that process.
{}
#+END_EXAMPLE

But I just started it!

Then it occurred to me I was being stupid, jacking into a =shadow-cljs= when there's
an already a running =watch= process, so this path was abandoned.

** Jacking in to clj REPL and adding a sibling cljs REPL connect for shadow-cljs

Keeping the =shadow-cljs watch app= process running in a terminal, I next tried =M-x
cider-jack-in-clj= to bring up just the =tools.deps= backend, followed by adding a
sibling =cljs= connection to the =nrepl= on port =9123= (courtesy of the =shadow-cljs
watch= running in the separate terminal)

As expected, everything went smoothly with the =M-x cider-jack-in-clj=.

=sesman= is correctly telling me I have only one =clj= REPL:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  1: Personal/starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow:localhost:35679
      linked-to: proj(~/Code/Personal/starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow/)
        objects: *cider-repl %s(clj)*
#+END_EXAMPLE

Time to add a sibling connection to that =nrepl= on port =9123= for the =cljs=:

=M-x cider-connect-sibling-cljs= then select =shadow= and =:app= build:

Same error as before:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
shadow-cljs has not been started yet!  In embedded mode you need to call
(shadow.cljs.devtools.server/start!) to start it.  If you have a shadow-cljs
server or watch running then you are not connected to that process.
{}
#+END_EXAMPLE

But it /is/ running. So I kill the repl.

Thinking I should use =shadow-select= for the repl type, I tried:

=M-x cider-connect-sibling-cljs= then select =shadow-select= and =:app= build:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; ClojureScript REPL type: shadow-select
;; ClojureScript REPL init form: (do (require '[shadow.cljs.devtools.api :as shadow]) (shadow/nrepl-select :app))
;;
:missing-nrepl-middlewareuser>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Jeez, okay. So at this point I start hacking some =.dir-locals.el= specifically to
add =shadow.cljs.devtools.server.nrepl/middleware= to
=cider-jack-in-nrepl-middlewares= and and establish a =custom= repl type as per [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2946#issuecomment-768140666][this
issue]]

This kind of works but I always end up with two separate =sesman= sessions that,
whilst both linked to my project, fail to work well when switching between =clj=,
=cljc=, and =cljs= source files.

With the =clj= REPL as the one most recently used, jumping to REPL from a =cljs= file
reports:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cider--no-repls-user-error: No cljs REPLs in current session "Personal/starter-cider-tools-deps-shadow:localhost:35679"
#+END_EXAMPLE

And likewise for =clj= files, if the =cljs= REPL was the last one used.

Bletch, what a pain...

So, don't do any of the stupid things I did above, adopt the =.dir-locals.el= and method described in the Takeaways, and all should be well.

Using =shadow-cljs= seems an order of magnitude faster; very sweet indeed!
